# Project-0-RFID-Debit-Card

Hey everyone. Over the holidays I created a small "debit card" system that uses RFID cards and a Mini RC522 scanner along with an app I made in Unreal. 
<br />
This is lovingly called Project Zero as it's an unofficial start to this year of new projects. I did not have a chance to film everything so there is no way I can count this as a full project. I will be working on a new and improved version later in the year as well ðŸ™‚
<br />
In this system the RFID cards and scanner control most things. You scan a card and if it's found in the database it will return the users info, if not it will go to the add new users screen.
<br />
After a card is scanned and the info is up on the screen you can edit the details, or start a sale. 
<br />
The sale has a input box you can just put in how much the things costs with your number pad or use it as a slider.  It will tell you how much balance is left after the transaction. If the balance is positive you can scan the card a second time to confirm the sale and it will adjust the users blance in database.
<br />
You can also access the user data manually in the save folder in case you want to make edits to a card without having the actual card to scan. Everything is held in plain text to easily edit in a text program.

# Included

STL files for 3D printed RFID card cases as well as the electronics housing
<br />
*The V1 case for the electronics was designed to be solder free.
<br />
the frtizing diagram
<br />
the Arduino .ino code
<br />
Unreal Engine app to run it all precompiled or source code for Unreal Engine 4.27
<br />
<br />

# What you will need 

Arduino Nano
<br />
Mini Breadboard
<br />
Mini RFID-RC522
<br />
0.96 Inch 4Pin I2C OLED
<br />

# How To Make it work

To make the system work you firstly assemble the components as shown in the fritzing diagram.
<br />
Than upload the .ino sketch to your Arduino
<br />
Open the Unreal app and go into settings and set the COM port that your Arduino is using.
<br />
Scan an RFID card while the app is open to add a new user
<br />
